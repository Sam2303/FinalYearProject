    <string name="app_name">Code Tracer</string>
    <string name="HowToText">The App works by asking you a question. Your task is to track through the code and enter the correct answer.
    You will receive a response to your answer saying if you got it correct or incorrect.
    The app has levels which get increasingly harder as you progress.
    Hint: Take it slow and read very carefully, also the spacing of your answers are very important, make sure you space everything correctly for
    a good quality of code!
    Have Fun and enjoy!</string>
